					<h2>YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED</h2>
					<ol>
						<li id="question1">
							What is the difference between Raw Maca and Gelatnized Maca?
							<br>
							<p>Gelatinized Maca refers to the process of removing the starches from the product allowing for easier digestion. Gelatinization uses heat to break the cellular walls of the starch molecules and they are extracted from the Maca. Raw Maca has the most enzymes, vitamins and nutrients intact as it is low temperature processed. We offer both so you can choose which best suits your lifestyle.</p>
						</li>
						<li id="question2">
							What is the difference between Cocoa and can I use them in the same way?
							<br>
							<p>Often times the terms cacao and cocoa are synonymous when referring to a powsered confectionary chocolate. However, the term cocoa can also refer to a combination of ingredients that represent a chocolate flavor, but also include sugar, dried milk, and/or other colorings or additives. Navitas Organics Cacao Powder is organic, non-GMO, pure, fairly traded, and non-alkalized. ure Cacao is 100% chocolate, rich in flavor, and ntritionally abundant. Navitas Organics Cacao Powder can be used as a 1:1 substitute for conventional cocoa.</p>
						</li>
						<li id="question3">
							How can you be sure Navitas Organic Goji Berries from China are really organic?
							<br>
							<p>We source our premium Goji Berries from the lush valleys of the Ningxia Province in China We believe that this is where the best Gojis are grown. Our Gojis are grown on certified organic farms and are certified organic by the USDA. Additionally, Navitas Organics uses third party lab testing in the USA to ensure the Goji Berries we sell are pesticide free, sulfite free, dangerous microbes and free of any other additives or chemicals.</p>
						</li>
						<li id="question4">
							I'm thinking about finally getting a good blender. Is there anything else I can use it for besides smoothies?
							<br>
							<p>A good blender can quickly become the most invaluable investment in your kitchen. Smoothies are really only a tiny fraction of what these incredible machines can do! Here's some ways you can use your blender to create all kinds of healthy cuisine. </p>
							<p>Soups - Whether pureeing a hot soup into sliky-smooth bliss, or combining cool ingredients to make an instant chilled soup, it's exciting to make meal-ready magic as the result of a quick whiz. What's more, you can sometimes save your stove space, too: some high-speed blenders can even gently warm cold soups after a couple minutes of blending on high.</p>
							<p>Frozen Desserts - The most unique and healthy frozen desserts can be made in a blender! Blending frozen fruit with a little bit of non-diary milk, juice, or water can instantly create a luxurious sorbet, granite, or ice cream - no extra freezing time needed! These desserts are the perfect base to add in some of your favorite superfood powders too, such as acai powder, or cacao powder.</p>

					<h6>WHY DO I NEED TO USE A DOUBLE BOILER TO MELT CACAO?</h6>
					<p>Not only is Hemp Powder a dense source of protein by weight, it is also a wonderful vegetarian source of "conplete" protein. Oftentimes non-animal protein sources do not contain all 9 essential amino acids that from a complete protein. Hemp comes packed naturally with all essential amino acids and is utilized and digested easily by the body.</p>
